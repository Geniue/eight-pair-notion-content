        <br />
        One of the easiest ways to find a big business opportuity is to travel
        to a different country and identify a thriving business that hasnt yet
        entered the USA or vice versa. This website allows you to spy on
        e-commerce ads that are on youtube and see if they are new to market and
        being scaled. This tells us if the business is profitable with selling
        thier product through youttube advertising.
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Next take the idea and do it yourself on a different platform like facebook ads, tiktok ads etc…</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://www.videoadvault.com">Videoadvault.com</a> is a tool
        that allows businesses to access a database of high-converting Youtube
        video ads. These ads can be used as inspiration for creating videos for
        your own business or for testing in your ad campaigns. The tool also
        provides data on the performance of each ad, including engagement rates
        and conversion rates, allowing you to further optimize your video ads
        for maximum results.

        <strong>4. Shophunter.io </strong>
        <br />
        This tool allows you to look inside any E-commerce business and see how
        much revenue they are producing in real time. Ive tested this tool on my
        own stores and it is about 85% accurate which is good enoguh for us to
        know if what the business is doing is a good opportunity to hop on.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because we can create businesses online in a matter of hours it all
        comes down to seeing what is working for someone else and setting up
        shop either to compete against them or sell in a different market that
        hasnt been conquered yet.

        automatically detect the subject of the image and remove the background,
        saving you time and effort in Photoshop or other image editing software.

        If you don’t know how to do a specific task when building your business,
        you can hire someone who specializes in it from a foreign country with
        cheaper labour for as low as $5. This helps me get things done like
        graphic design, seo, coding etc… that I either dont have enough time for
        or don’t have the highest skill set in.
