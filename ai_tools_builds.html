      <h1>AI Tools For our 3 Brand Builds</h1>

      <p>
        First here are some updates on the stores progress going into the second month.
        </p>
    <br>
    <br>

      <p>
        So in the first month, we brought in about 20%-30% profit depending on the store.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

      <p>
        The first month is usually less profitable because we start out with less efficient suppliers with more expensive per unit cost and also we like to spend as much as possible on advertising to test new creatives (ad videos) as we can think of so that we can put our money into the most profitable ones in the second month where we switch to better suppliers, clean up operations and scale.    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        First month we hit a collective $125k in revenue. Reinvesting a big portion of the profits into making our website better, better suppliers and like I said testing videos.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Here’s the results for this month the first days we re-launched them with new suppliers, operations etc… We will be able to scale to $10k/day within the next 1-2 weeks on all stores.    </p>

        <br>
<p>
    In JULY we are aiming to hit around $400k-$500k as a collective.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    The best thing about this is because we’re building all of them simultaneously. I am proving that they can all follow a very similar system, which I am building into a software to basically print businesses like this. So far so smooth.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    Now lets get into the AI tools we used so far…
</p>
<br>

<div style="background: rgb(20, 58, 78);padding: 7px;margin-bottom: 3px;">

    <p>
        1. ChatGPT
        
        
        <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
            <br>
            <li>We used ChatGPT for most of our website copy, some of our ad copy and our refund policy and other legal pages. Without it this part used to take a few hours now it takes minutes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>
<div style="background: rgb(20, 58, 78);padding: 7px;">

            This is a chrome extension for google trends that provides more insights on trends that google does. Like where the trend is created from, other trends that are similar, trends within this trend and a prediction using AI and real time data to see where the trend is going in the next few months.        </li>
            <li>
                This is an insane tool for opportunity research. Finding your winning product/demand, finding marketing angles etc…
