      <p>PRICING STRAT</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I would make the app Free trial so eliminate friction and get people
        seeing results ASAP. we want to adopt them into our community.
        <br />
        Then we want to put our supplements within each workout routine so
        people know when to take them and what they do.
        <br />
        Ex. take 5mg of creatine everyday to increase strength and water volume
        to muscles for maximum growth potential.
