      <h1>Google Brand Search Campaign</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        I have never seen this marketing strategy before. The reason why is
        because there has never been a way to customize multiple product
        packaging designs in seconds.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        [Supliful.com](http://Supliful.com) makes that possible. What a time we
        live in.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Step 1.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Create multiple packaging designs for your product.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I suggest creating designs that separate yourself from the competition
        already on google.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Use bright colors</p>
      <br />
      <p>Step 2.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now you need to set up one Google Brand Search Campaign for each variant
        of your product
