        EASY!!!
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Step 1.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Optimize Store.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
        <li>
            go to fiverr and buy an SEO + Speed boost for your website. ($60)
        </li>
        <li>
            If your conversion rate is below 2% it needs to be raised (speed boost will help this a ton already)
        </li>
        <li>

      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

            Also Upsell a $3.97 warranty
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Step 2.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Expand Marketing</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
        <li>Figure out which of the videos you posted got the most views/engagement</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Go to twitter and find UGC creators that can re make these videos well by searching up #UGC and DMing them</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Give them a custom link to track their revenue with Shortly by Shortlink app</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Give them 25%-50% commission of all the sales they produce from remaking those best performing videos and posting on to IG reels, TT and YT shorts on their own accounts they made just for this.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Start retargeting ads to retarget the millions of people who views your videos with advertisements explaining your product and offer more clearly. A review of someone trying them would work great.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Start doing the same but to cold audiences (BOOST BUDGET BABY!!)</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>
            Setup back end marketing:
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
            <p>a. SMS+EMAIL</p>
            <br>
            <p>b. GOOGLE ADS</p>
        </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
      <p>
        There you go if you execute all of this you should be on your way to your first $1m.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
