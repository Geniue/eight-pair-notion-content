        In this document, I will share my experience of how I generated $100k/month with my e-commerce business in the first month of its launch.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        To start with, I researched and identified a high-demand product niche with low competition. This helped me to focus on the target audience and create a unique value proposition for my customers.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Next, I optimized my website for user experience and branded feel. I made sure that the website was mobile-friendly and easy to navigate (90% of shoppers are mobile).      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I leveraged social media platforms to drive traffic to my website. 
    </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        In this case 2/3 stores were scaled with TikTok Ads.  </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        And 1/3 was scaled with FB ads and TikTok ads.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Furthermore, I offered a special promotion to my early customers to incentivize them to make a purchase. This helped me to generate a buzz and create a sense of urgency around my product.      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Finally, I provided excellent customer service and fast shipping to ensure customer satisfaction. This led to positive reviews and word-of-mouth referrals, which helped to drive more sales.      <br />
      <p>
        In conclusion, my strategy of identifying a niche with low competition, optimizing my website, leveraging social media, offering promotions, and providing excellent customer service helped me to generate $100k/month in the first month of my e-commerce business launch.ure customer satisfaction. This led to positive reviews and word-of-mouth referrals, which helped to drive more sales.      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>In JULY we are expecting to hit $200k/month with 20-40% profit margins for 2/3 stores and $100k/month with the third store with 20-30% profit margins.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        It really is a simple process. The only reason most people say it is hard is because of lack of self discipline to never quit and keep self incentivized to learn valuable skills rather than a professor keeping you on a leash to get good enough grades to pass.
