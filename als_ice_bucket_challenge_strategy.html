      <h1>ALS Ice Bucket Challenge - Strategy</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge went viral due to several factors. First,
        it was a unique and engaging way to raise awareness and funds for ALS
        research. The challenge involved individuals dumping a bucket of ice
        water over their head and challenging others to do the same or donate to
        ALS research. This created a fun and viral social media trend that
        spread quickly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Second, the challenge was easy to participate in and share with others.
        Participants could easily record and share videos of themselves
        completing the challenge on social media platforms such as Facebook and
        Twitter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Finally, the challenge was supported by many celebrities and public
        figures, which helped to increase its visibility and credibility. This
        led to widespread media coverage and further contributed to the
        challenge's success.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Overall, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge's virality can be attributed to
        its unique and engaging nature, ease of participation and sharing, and
        support from influential individuals.

      <br />
      <p>What we want to do is do the same exact method but with a twist.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Step 1.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Order in branded product from supplier with our brand name ex.
        #dailydunk
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Step 2.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Do creator/influencer research ton build a list of micro influencers to
        send our product to and start our challenge
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Step 3.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Send product to our influencers and challenge them to a
        #30daydunkchallenge
      </p>
      <p>Rules:

          <ul>
              <li>
                Must dunk in our ice bath 30 times in a row
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    every time you dunk you must nominate someone else to dunk
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    every time our hashtag is used with a video using our Ice Baths, we donate $1 to suicide prevention
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Note: based on my experience with organic marketing I believe that there will be plenty of profit left after we pay $1 per hashtag count.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    This will all lead to a snowball effect of virality and will drive traffic to our brand. 
                </li>
                <br>
            </ul>
        </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
