                ii. You can set a rule to turn off after 1000 impressions per
                adset.

                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br />

              <p>
                e. Now re-do this whole process for each dissection against your
                competitors original ads.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br />
            <div class="ps-3">
              <p>
                f. Through this process you are looking for getting the highest
                CTR, and (Quality Ranking, Engagement Ranking, Conversion Rate
                Ranking) all above average.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br />
     
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>LAST TEST</p>
          <br />
          <div class="ps-3">
            <p>
              a. Now that you’ve narrowed down on the best possible variations
              of ads for your market, you need to test them optimizing for
              Conversions and see if they work for the goal audience.
              <br />
              b. (Quality Ranking, Engagement Ranking, Conversion Rate Ranking)
              all above average.
              <br />
              c. Test with 5-10 adsets in a new ABO campaign
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If the test goes well, throw it all into a High budget CBO broad and
          watch the magic happen.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <p>
            If the test doesnt workout, the competitors still have better
            creatives and you need to keep testing.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <br />

        media buying space.

        this strategy.
