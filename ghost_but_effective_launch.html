      <h1>Ghost - Cheap But Effective Launch</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        First of all thanks for showing interest in learning the next steps,
        momentum is key and you’ve already started gaining it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the first video I showed how it is truly amazing how you can build
        the foundation of an e-commerce brand similar to the 9 figure brand
        Ghost within just a couple hours using Shopify, Supliful, Replo and
        ChatGPT.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As exciting that information is, the job isnt done yet. Now the business
        needs to launch and begin capturing profits.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The business model that I personally go for every time is building an
        E-commerce brand based off of a spike in demand I find from seeing other
        Successful companies arise or finding a trend with a software like
        explodingtopics.com.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Step 1. Market Research</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In this step you will need to gather info and insperation from direct
        and non-direct competitors in order to set up a Content Flywheel that is
        effective and in-expensive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Let’s start with Direct Competitors.</p>
      <br />
      <p>To do this navigate to TikTok on your phone and search these terms:</p>
      <br />
      <p>#Ghost #protein #supplements #preworkout</p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Sort by:
        <br />

        <br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What you are looking for are video that are proven to work for other
        people, businesses accounts in the past. This way we are not
        re-inventing the wheel. We need to collect as many viral ideas that
        match our goal of making people interested in our product.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>We will use these ideas in the next steps.</p>
      <br />

      <p>Now lets do the same with Indirect competitors:</p>
      <p>To do this navigate to TikTok on your phone and search these terms:</p>
      <p>#Ghost #protein #supplements #preworkout</p>
      <br />

        <br />
        #seamoss #batanaoil #beeftallow
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h2>Step 2. Plan The Pump</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now that we have the marketing ideas that are proven and have a high
        potential to go viral again in a different setting, we need to plan who
        and how were going to film and show these videos to the world so
        advertise our new brand.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Start by creating a post on Twitter like this:</p>
      <div style="background: rgba(115, 115, 115, 0.28); padding: 7px">
        <p>Looking for a #UGC creator for a $1,000-$5,000/month brand deal</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you’re into mushroom coffee and other natural remedies this one is
          for YOU!
          <br />
          Like, RT, Comment and DM if you’re interested or know someone who
          would be a good fit!
          <br />
          #UGCcreator #ugccommunity
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />

      <p>
        I look for people to create UGC (User Generated Content) for my business
        like this all the time. Works like a charm.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Heres an average post I’ve made in the past with almost 300 inquiries to
        choose from:
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="assets/Screen_Shot_2023-04-26_at_8.30.48_PMadfs.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        From here sort through all of the creators who inquired and choose your
        top 10
      </p>
      <p>
        Reach out to them and ask them if they are interested in doing a Revenue
        Share deal with your Mushroom Coffee brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll send them free product and give them 30% of the revenue generated
        by their videos through a link in bio.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Now download this app on your
        <br />
        shopify store:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This app will allow tyou to create a unique link for them and track
        revenue they generated to your shopify store.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Do this and repeat to all top 10 inquries.</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Step 3. Execute</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the previous tutorial I posted on my socials, I showed how we can get
        the product for $6.50 per unit from Supliful with our logo/branding
        already on the packaging.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Order one unit to each of your chosen inquiries.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Tell them to create a video every single day copying the inspiration
        videos we collected in Step 1. to gain traction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Keynote - Not everyone will agree to this deal so keep searching for
        those who do agree if you want to do this for near zero upfront cost. If
        youre willing to invest $1-2 thousand it will just speed up the process
        by getting people paid on a 1-2 hundred dollar per week retainer to do
        this for you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now they must upload all the videos into a google drive folder so that
        you can post all the videos on your Main Profiles on IG reels, TikTok,
        YT Shorts, Snapchat Spotlight. After repeating this cycle for a week or
        2, you should be able to spot some of your videos doing better than
        others.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Use these videos and upload the to TikTok ads to then promote them and
        force them to be seen by people instead of waiting for the alogrithm to
        give them traction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        From here you should be able to reach $1k-$2k/day in revenue with your
        new business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Step 4. Learn</h2>
      <br />

      <br />
      <h2>Step 5. Vision Bonus Scale ($3k-$50k/day potential)</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Once you have established a steady revenue stream, it's time to think
        about scaling. Consider investing in more marketing strategies, such as
        influencer marketing or Facebook ads. You can also expand your product
        line to attract a wider audience. Make sure to continually analyze your
        data to see what's working and what's not, and adjust your strategy
        accordingly. With the right approach, your business could grow to be a
        major player in the e-commerce industry.
