        this is the method I started my first online businesses with.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>I actually did the same thing but instead of supplements I did socks with a company called TeeSpring</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        At the time Trump and Juuls were trending so I made a sock design on canva of Trump smoking a juul.      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        I paid a partying page and a conservative themed page on IG around $50-$100 for a 24 hours post on their page.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        I ended up selling $200 dollars of socks for each post leaving me with around a hundred profit.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        I scaled this up by just doing more of the same thing.
      </p>

        GoodLuck.
