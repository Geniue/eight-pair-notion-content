      <h1>TikTok SEO Hack</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        TikTok has become an increasingly popular platform for searching for
        keywords due to its algorithm. When users search for a keyword on
        TikTok, the algorithm takes into account the user's interaction history
        and preferences to provide them with relevant content. This means that
        TikTok's search results are tailored to the individual user, rather than
        providing a generic list of results like Google. As a result, many users
        have found that TikTok is more effective for discovering new content and
        trends related to specific keywords.

        <br />
        <li>
          Cross-promote your accounts: Promote your new accounts on your main
          account and vice versa. This can help drive traffic to your new
          accounts and increase your overall reach.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Use the same SEO tactics: Use the same SEO tactics on your new
          accounts as you did on your main account. This includes using relevant
          and specific hashtags, engaging and descriptive captions, and
          incorporating trending sounds and music.

          results. Aim to post at least once a day or a few times a week.

          custom audience. To create a custom audience, go to the Audience tab
          in your TikTok Ads account and select Custom Audience. From there, you
          can select the criteria for your audience, such as users who have

        <br />
        <li>
          Monitor and optimize your ad performance: Once your retargeting ad is

          results. Keep track of the metrics, such as click-through rate and
          conversion rate, and make adjustments to your targeting and ad
          creative as needed.

          Analyze your results: Keep track of the performance of your new

        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        By following these steps, you can effectively set up retargeting ads on
        TikTok to target users who have interacted with your viral videos but
        did not convert, and increase your chances of making sales from those
        users.
