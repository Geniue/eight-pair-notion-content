        Building an army of AI influencers can create massive opportunity to leverage their following to promote brand deals or advertise your own online businesses. By using MidJourney to generate unique and exclusive content, you can offer a new and exciting experience to followers. Additionally, by creating AI-generated voice notes or offering pay-per-minute texting, you can provide even more personalized interactions with these influencers. This opens up opportunities for brand deals, promotions, and advertising, which can be further amplified through DTC products using drop shipping, print on demand, and SAAS like the Rizz App. The potential market for this type of content is massive, as demonstrated by the success of platforms like [Carmen.ai](http://carmen.ai/) in generating hundreds of thousands of dollars. By tapping into this growing market, you can unlock new revenue streams and reach a wider audience.
