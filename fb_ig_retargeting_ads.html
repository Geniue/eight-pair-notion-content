            <li>Select "Campaign".</li>
            <li>
              Choose your campaign objective. The campaign objective should be
              aligned with your marketing goals, such as increasing brand
              awareness, generating leads, or driving sales.
            </li>
            <li>
              Name your campaign. Make sure the name is descriptive and makes it
              easy to identify the campaign.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set your campaign budget and schedule. The budget should be set
              based on your retargeting audience size and campaign goals. The
              schedule should be set based on the time when your audience is
              most active.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose your ad set settings. An ad set is a group of ads that
              share the same target audience, budget, and schedule. Choose your

          Create retargeting ads for Instagram profile engagers
          <br />
          After creating a retargeting campaign, the next step is to create
          retargeting ads specifically for users who have engaged with your
          Instagram profile. Follow the below steps to create retargeting ads
          for Instagram profile engagers:
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Choose your ad format. The ad format should be aligned with your
              campaign objective and the ad set settings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose your ad creative. The ad creative should be visually
              appealing and aligned with your brand messaging. Since you are
              targeting users who have engaged with your Instagram profile,
              consider using images or videos related to your Instagram content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choose your ad placement. The ad placement should be selected as
              "Instagram" since you are targeting users who have engaged with
              your Instagram profile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set your targeting to "Engaged with your business profile on
              Instagram". This will ensure that your ads are only shown to users
              who have previously engaged with your Instagram profile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Review and confirm your ad. Before publishing the ad, make sure to
              review it to ensure that there are no errors.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By following this SOP, you can create retargeting ads specifically for
        users who have engaged with your Instagram profile. These ads can help
        you increase engagement and conversions from users who have already
        shown interest in your brand on Instagram.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        After creating a retargeting campaign, the next step is to create
        retargeting ads. Follow the below steps to create retargeting ads:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Choose your ad format. The ad format should be aligned with your
          campaign objective and the ad set settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose your ad creative. The ad creative should be visually appealing
          and aligned with your brand messaging.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose your ad placement. The ad placement should be selected based on
          the platform where your retargeting audience is most active, such as
          Facebook or Instagram.
        </li>
        <li>
          Review and confirm your ad. Before publishing the ad, make sure to
          review it to ensure that there are no errors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h3>Budget and Campaign Structure</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        When setting up your retargeting campaign, consider the following best
        practices in terms of budget and campaign structure:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Set a budget that is appropriate for your retargeting audience size
          and campaign goals. A higher budget does not always guarantee better
          results.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a single campaign with multiple ad sets to target different
          segments of your retargeting audience. Targeting different segments
          can help you personalize your ad messaging and optimize your ad spend.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set different ad creatives for each ad set to test which ones perform
          the best. Testing different ad creatives can help you identify the
          best-performing ads and optimize your ad spend.
        </li>

        <p>
          By following this SOP, you can set up a retargeting campaign on
          Facebook and Instagram to reach users who previously interacted with
          your page. Retargeting ads can help you increase your conversion rate
          and reduce your customer acquisition costs.
