      <h1>Guru Business Model Comparison</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        First of all thanks for showing interest in learning the next steps, momentum is key and you’ve already started gaining it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        They are all very similar, and you need to understand all of them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now when starting your own business you need to know that all of these businesses require marketing efforts, so from here you need to choose the product you can supply to your marketing efforts with the highest ROI for the most efficient in time, energy, and capital.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The business model that I personally go for every time is building an E-commerce brand based off of a spike in demand I find from seeing other Successful companies arise or finding a trend with a software like explodingtopics.com.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        From there I look at all of our available product types below plus more that I dint list like digital products, SAAS etc… and then figure out which one suits my market the best, which one is the easiest and quickest to get started (some can be started instantly), which one takes the least capital risk, and which one takes the least fulfilment effort so I can scale without working about growing a team, or buying more inventory so I can focus all my efforts on growing the business instead of maintaining the business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The businesses I start hire SMMA Agencies to delegate my marketing, sell on amazon as an extra source of revenue, hire affiliate marketers to sell our product for us, etc…
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        I hope this made it easy for you to understand to look more at the bigger picture and allow yourself to float on top of all these gurus information and choose the best opportunity for yourself to hit your financial, and lifestyle goals.
