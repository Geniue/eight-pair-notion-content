      <h2>Twitter UGC Strategy</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        Twitter is a great platform to find user-generated content (UGC)
        creators. By using a software stack including Twitter, Hypefury,
        Typeform, and relevant hashtags, you can easily find and recruit UGC
        creators for your brand or business. This is fully automated, takes
        minutes, and is a crutial step to creating a content flywheel that will
        produce thousands of dollars a day. ##
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Step 1: Create a new Twitter Account</h2>
      <p>
        Create a twitter account that appears to be an account that helps
        provide value and jobs for UGC creators.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Ex. @ugcdaily</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Step 2: Follow and engage with UGC profiles</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Look up #UGC in the search bar and then follow 50-100 UGC creators.
        <br />
        Like, comment and engage in some of their posts.
        <br />
        This will tigger twitters algorithm to recognize you are interested in
        UGC content so it will reccomend UGC creators on you “For You Page”
        along with alos putting your future tweets on theirs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Step 3: Create a HypeFury Account</h2>
      <br />

        Here’s an example of a recent tweet I made for one of my businesses:
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <div class="text-center">
        <img
          width="500"
          src="./assets/Screen_Shot_2023-05-23_at_11.11.45_PM.png"
          alt=""
        />
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        As you can see almost 400 experienced UGC creators inquired. I had more
        than enough to choose from.
        <br />
        <br />
        I put $1,000-$5,000 earning potential at the top because thats usually
        how much I end up paying my UGC creators once they prove to provide me
        with content that is profitable. from here I lock them in a commission
        deal and get them to post videos with my product daily on an organic
        tiktok page. I pay them based on 20%-30% of the revenue they produce
        through their link in bio I created for them using a Shopify app called
        “Shortly by ShortLink”.
        <br />
        This app tracks their revenue.
        <br />
        <br />
        You’ll find this box in the bottom right corner of HypeFury.
        <br />
        <br />
        Write your tweet and then set up “Send an automatic DM” in the bottom
        left
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <div class="text-center">
        <img
          width="500"
          src="./assets/Screen_Shot_2023-05-23_at_11.18.12_PM.png"
          alt=""
        />
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Set it up just like I did in this example below:</p>
      <br />
      <div class="text-center">
        <img
          width="400"
          src="./assets/Screen_Shot_2023-05-23_at_11.20.05_PM.png"
          alt=""
        />
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Make sure to input your TypeForm or Google Form in the [form_link]
        Section.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Here are the questions I put in my forms.</p>
      <br />
      <div class="text-center">
        <img
          width="290"
          src="./assets/Screen_Shot_2023-05-23_at_11.22.05_PM.png"
          alt=""
        />
        <br />
        <img
          width="290"
          src="./assets/Screen_Shot_2023-05-23_at_11.22.25_PM.png"
          alt=""
        />
      </div>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Now press SAVE and then POST it! By the next day youll have hundreds of
        applications to work with you automaitically and it usually grows
        consistently for weeks or even months.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
