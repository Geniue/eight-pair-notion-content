      <h2>Older Sibling Method</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        When it comes to purchasing products, people tend to be influenced by
        various factors, and one of them is the influence of someone with
        status. This phenomenon is commonly known as the "older sibling method"
        and has been observed in many consumer behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The older sibling method is based on the idea that individuals tend to
        look up to someone who is older, wiser, and more experienced than them.
        In the context of purchasing products, this could be an older sibling, a
        parent, a friend, or anyone with whom the person has a close
        relationship and trusts their opinion.

        In this case YoungLa signed a young up and coming Lifestyle Fitness
        TikToker right as he was early in growth. He goes by the name of Soosh.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Once Soosh started wearing YoungLa, all of the followers who looked up
        to Soosh wanted to now wear YoungLa as well. These younger fans
        eventually turned into big fitness creators themselves as well and then
        started promoting YoungLa as well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Today YoungLa has hundreds of Young Fitness Lifestyle creators that go
        viral on the daily promoting their clothing for 10%-30% (estimate)
        commission on everything they sell through their custom link or discount
        code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        This “Older Sibling Method” can be used for any new up and coming market
        created by TikTok or any viral social media trend or you can tackle this
        same exact industry as YoungLa as its still new and has room for more
        brands that have different styles, vibes or uses.

        Ex. Supplements for women, Pump Covers, Cropped Gym Wear, Old School Gy
        Wear etc…

        You can use Printful + Shopify + The app Shortly by Short Link as a
        combo to accomplish this.

        This method can work to force almost any “Proven Product” to become a
        company with massive Brand Equity.
