      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The objective of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to provide a
        step-by-step guide for reaching out to up and coming TikTok cooking
        influencers and collaborating with them to build an e-commerce recipe
        subscription business off of their audience for partial royalties.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <br />
      <ol style="list-style: decimal">
        <li>
          <strong> Identify potential TikTok cooking influencers </strong>
          : Research and identify TikTok cooking influencers with a growing
          audience and engagement. Look for influencers who have a unique
          cooking style and have the potential to stand out in the market that
          also are NOT selling anything yet or just promoting other companies.
          They would rather own majority in their own company that we build for
          them.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong> Research their audience </strong>
          : After identifying potential influencers, research their audience to
          understand their demographics, interests, and preferences. This will
          help in developing a suitable subscription model and content for the
          influencer's audience.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare a partnership proposal</strong>: Develop a partnership
          proposal that outlines the benefits of collaborating with your
          e-commerce recipe subscription business. The proposal should include:
        </li>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>An introduction to your business and its goals</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A clear explanation of how the partnership will work, including

          <br />

          <br />
          <li>
            A value proposition that outlines why the influencer should
            collaborate with your business and the benefits they will receive.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A timeline for the partnership, including when the subscription plan
            will launch and how long the partnership will last.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            A call to action that encourages the influencer to respond

            collaborating.

          <br />

              identified influencers through their TikTok account, email, or any
              other preferred communication channel. Introduce your business and
              the partnership proposal, and emphasize the potential benefits for
              both parties.
            </li>

              finalizing the terms.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>

              for money.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong> Launch and market the subscription plan</strong>: Launch
              the subscription plan and market it through the influencers'
              TikTok account and other social media channels. Monitor the
              performance of the subscription plan and make necessary
              adjustments to improve its success.
            </li>

      <h2>What I would send to them:</h2>
      <br />
      <p>First message:</p>
      <br />
      <p>“I’ll pay you $100,000/month”</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Once you get their attention:</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I build e-commerce businesses to multiple 6 figures a month and I saw
        that you don’t have a business to monetize your following. (or I saw
        that you promote other businesses for, ever thought of promoting your
        own?)
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>GOAL:</p>
      <br />
      <p>Lock them in on a 50/50 partnership</p>
      <br />
      or
      <br />
      Lock them in a 60/40
      <br />
      or
      <br />
      Lock them in a 70/30
      <br />
      or
      <br />
      Lock them in a 80/20
      <br />
      <br />
      I wouldn’t go lower than 80/20
      <br />
      <br />
      Needs to be worth your time.
